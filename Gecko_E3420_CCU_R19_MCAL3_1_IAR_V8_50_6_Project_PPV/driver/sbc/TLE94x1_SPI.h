 *          In case, the SPI hardware is already initialized by some other code before, it can be left blank.
 *
 * @retval  Method has to return 0 if initialization was successful.

/**
 * @brief   IMPORTANT! THIS METHOD HAS TO BE DEFINED BY THE USER
 *
 *          The function will be called by the library everytime when a SPI communication is needed.
 *          The function proceeds a bidirectional 16-bit transfer to/from the SBC  .
 *          As some UCs only supports 8-Bit transfers, the input arguments are split in two 8-bit arguments.
 *          For further implementation details have a look at datasheet chapter 13.1 or at the Arduino-examples.
 *
 * @param   Upper   The first 8 bit to transmit to the SBC.
 * @param   Lower   The second 8 bit to transmit to the SBC.
 * @retval  The function will return all 16 bits received from the SBC.
 *          Bit[15:8] are the first 8 bits received (Status-Information-Field).
 *          Bit[7:0] is the data-field transmitted of the SBC.
